# Prediction of MAMP-Receptor Interactions through a Protein Language Model

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the paper: mamp-ml: A deep learning approach to epitope immunogenicity in plants.

To follow the meta-analysis as well building the model for immunogenicity prediciton in plants, see the following markdown file [mamp_ml_building_and_validation](./mamp_ml_building_and_validation.md).

Interested in using mamp-ml? Please see our other GitHub [repo](https://github.com/DanielleMStevens/mamp-ml) with production code and Google Colab.
